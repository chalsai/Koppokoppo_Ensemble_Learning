# Define the question

Background Information

Koppokoppo is a company that offers market-appropriate solutions to enable and incentivize businesses to go digital. The company partners with financial institutions, mobile operators and major retailers who are interested in marketing new payment services to small and medium enterprises. In turn, the company offers small and medium enterprises loans.

# The data analysis question

The objective of this project is to create a model that will predict whether a loan offered to a certain small and medium enterprise will be paid off.

# Solution steps
- Import libraries
- Data exploration: load data, preview and explore data, check for and handle missing values and duplicates, fix inconsistent column names if any
- Data preparation: prepare data for use in model training
- Data modeling: create, train and evaluate the model
- Summarise findings and provide recommendations


# Summary of Findings
Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, Ada Boosting, Gradient Boosting and XG Boosting classifiers performed optimally

# Recommendations
Try cross and K-folds validations and see if model performance will improve

# Challenging the Solution
a) Did we have the right question? Yes
b) Did we have the right data? Yes
c) What can be done to improve the solution? Cross and K-folds validations
# Improving the Solution
We will try cross validation and K-Folds cross validation in an attempt to improve our models.
